# SpellCheck
SpellChecker app pertaining to Fundamentals of Programming 

In this project, using knowledge from the second semester 
of Fundamentals of Programming, I've made a simple spell
checker program.

What this program does is that it inputs a phrase, of any
kind, and then it checks it for grammatical and spelling
errors. IT will correct lowercase i-s if they're standalone,
it will expect phrases to contain an uppercase Letter at the
start and a form of punctuation at the end. Beyond this,
drawing from the dictionary.txt file, it will have a database
of roughly 400'000 words to look at (the code doesn't
discriminate in terms of uppercase or lowercase spelling), 
when checking the spelling, leaving minimal space for error 
and such misunderstanding.
